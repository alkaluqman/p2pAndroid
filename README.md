# Peer-to-Peer Federated Learning Android App

## Overview

This Android application enables on-device machine learning through P2P FL. By leveraging Bluetooth and Android’s P2P WiFi, the app allows multiple devices to collaborate and improve their ML models by exchanging knowledge directly with peers. This approach ensures that models are enhanced in real-time without needing a central server, maximizing user privacy and reducing dependency on cloud resources.

## Features

- **Peer-to-Peer Federated Learning**: FL strategies for aggregating knowledge across peers.
- **Bluetooth Communication**: As 1st POC to exchange data and model updates over Bluetooth.
- **P2P WiFi Communication**: For faster and more efficient data transfer.
- **On-Demand Model Improvement**: with nearby devices.

## Requirements

- Android 11 or higher
- Bluetooth and P2P WiFi enabled on your device

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Build and run the app on an Android device.

## Usage

1. Setup: Ensure Bluetooth and P2P WiFi are enabled on your device.
2. Connect: Open the app and connect to nearby devices using the provided options.
3. Collaborate: Start the federated learning process by initiating model training and sharing with peers.
4. Monitor: Track the progress and improvements of your ML model through the app’s interface.
